Then, you will be given access to an online platform operated by the researchers, where you will be logging your low-intensity physical activities for a period of two weeks. The use of the platform is simple and not time consuming. After the 2-week period, you will be asked to fill in a second questionnaire. This questionnaire should not take more than 15-20 minutes to complete.</p>

The goal of collecting, analyzing, and storing this data is to answer the research question and publish the results in scientific literature. To protect your privacy, all data that can be used to personally identify you will be stored on an encrypted server of the Human Technology Interaction group for at least 10 years that is only accessible by selected HTI staff members. No information that can be used to personally identify you will be shared with others. No video or audio recordings are made that could identify you.
